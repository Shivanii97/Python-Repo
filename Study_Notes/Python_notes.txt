What is Programming?
    Programming is a way to us to tell computers what to do.Computer is a ver dumb machine and it only does
    what we tell it to do,Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are slow at doing 
    computation. Just like we use hindi or english to communicate with each other, we use a programming
    langugage just like python to communicate with the computers.
    Programming is a way to instruct computers to perform various tasks.

What is Python?
    Pyhton is a simple and easy language which feels like reading simple english.Python is interpreted 
    and high-level language.

Features :
    Easy to understand = Less develpoment time
    High-level language
    Portable = works on linux/windows/mach(platform Independent)
    Cost free - No cost for leaning python

What Python is used for:
    Data Visualization to create plots and Graphical Representation.
    Create web application
    used to Handle database

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are Modules?
    A module is alike a code library which can be used to borrow the code written by somebody else
    in our python programs. Can be imported and used in our programs.

Types of Modules:
    Built-in-Modules - Pre installed in python.
    External Modules - Need to install using pip - import panda

What is Pip?
    Pip is a package mangaer for python, you can use pip to install a module.
    Whatever module which is not there in our system, we can use pip to install in our system. \
    Ex- pip3 install scikit-learn
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whar are comments?
    Comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to execute.
    Suppose if I am learning to write a program in python and want to remember for future also what
    I have written at that time. So. I will add some text over there to remeber in future, so I will
    use comments to add texts in program using <#>
    <#> is used for writing comments in programs.

    Ex:
    #What is the code for running program in python?
    Ex-  Print("Hello World")

 How to uncomment a text?
    ctrl+/

  Types of Comments
    1) Single Line Comments - #
        Ex- #Hello World    
            #This is Shivani
            #Good Morning

    2) Multi-Line Comments - '''_''' """_"""  
        Ex- '''
            Hello World
            This is Shivani
            Good Morning
            '''

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Escape Sequence Character?
    To inser charcters that cannot be used directly in a string, we use a escape sequence charcter.
    An escape sequence charcter is backslash <\> followed by the charcter you want to insert.


What is Separtor
    sep='separtor'. Specify how to separte the objects, if there is more than one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables and Data Types
    Variables is like a container that holds data. Very similar to how our containers in kitchen holds
    sugar,salt,etc. Creating a variable is like creating a placeholder in the memory and assigning it
    some value.

These are four variables of different data types
    a = 1
    b = true
    c = "Harry"
    d = none

What is a Data type?
    Data types specifies the type of valua a variable holds. This is required in programming to
    various operations without causing an error.

    In python, we can print the type of any operator by using type function:
    a=1
    print(type(a))
    b="1"
    print(type(b))

By default, python provide following built-in data types:

    1)Numeric Data - int,float,complex
    Ex:
    int: 3,-8,0
    float: 7.439,-9.0,0.00001
    complex:6+2i

    2)Txt data:str
    str."Hello World,"Python Programming"

    3)Boolean data:
    Boolean data consist of values True or False.

    4)Sequenced data:list,tuple
    #list: a list is an ordered collection of data separted by a comma and enclosed by square brackets.
          lists are mutable and can be modified after creation.
    Ex-
    list1 = [8,2.3,[-4,5],["apple,banana"]]
    print(list1)
    Output: [8,2.3,[-4,5],['apple,banana']]

    #Tuple: a list is an ordered collection of data separted by a comma and enclosed within parantheses.
            tuples are inmutables and cannot be modified after creation.
    Ex-
    tuple1 = (("parrot","eagle"),("apple","banana")
    print(tuple1)
    Output : (('parrot','eagle'),('apple','banana')

    5) Mapped data: dict
        dict: a dictionary is an ordered collection of data containg a key,:value pair. 
        The key: values are enclosed withib curly brackets.
    Ex- 
    dict1 = {"Name":"Sakshi","Age":20,"canVote":True}
    Output : {'Name':'Sakshi','Age':20,'canVote':True}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Operators
    Python has different operator. To create a calculator we require arithmetic Operators.
    + - Addition        print(5+6)
    (-) Substraction
    * - Multiplication
    ** - Exponential
    /  - Division
    % - Modulus        print(5%3), suppose if no. is 2.5 and you want only (2), so in that case you use
                       it, it gives you reminder.
    // - Floor Division

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Typecasting
The conversion of one data type into the another data type called type casting or
type conversion in python.
Python supports a wide variety of functions or methods like: int(), float(),str(),ord(),tuple(),set()
list(),etc..are the type casting in python...

Two Types of Typecasting:
 1)Explicit Typecasting
 2)Implicit Typecasting

Explicit typecasting - The conversion of one data type into the another data type, done via develpor
                        or programmer's
Implicit typecasting -

Taking User Input in Python

In python, we take user input directly by using input() function. This input function gives a return 
value as a string/charcter hence we have to pass that into a variable.
    Variable = input()
but input function returns the value as a string, hence we have to typecast
    variable = int(input())

We can also display a txt by using int(). This will make int() function take user input and display
and display a msg as well.
    a = input("Enter your Name:")
    print(a) 
    output = Enter your name: Shivani

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Strings Methods
Python provides a set of built-in methods we can

***upper():
str1 = "AbSBdNy"
print(str1.upper())
output = ABSBDNY

***lower():
str1 = "AbSBdNy"
print(str1.lower())
output = AbSBdNy

***strip(): the strip() method removes any white spaces before and after the string.
str2 = " Silver Spoon "
print(str2.strip)
output = Silver Spoon

***rstrip(): the rstrip() removes any trailing characters.
str3 = "Hello !!!"
print(str3.rstrip("!"))
output = Hello

***replace(): the replace() method replaces all occurences of a string with another string.
str2 = "Silver Spoon"



***split():it splits the given string at the specified instance and returns the separted strings as list
items:
str2 = "Silver Spoon"
print(str2.split(" "))
output = ['Silver', 'Spoon']

***Captialize : methods turns only the first character of the string to uppercase and the rest of the
strings to lowercase. The string has no effect if the first chacter is already uppercase.

str1 = "hello"
capstr1 = str1.capitalize()
print(capstr1)
output = Hello

str2 = "hello worLD"
capstr2 = str2.capitalize()
print(capstr2)
output = Hello world

***Center(): it aligns the strings to the center as per the parameter given by the user:

str1 = "Welcome to the Console!!!"
print(str1.center(50))
output =                Welcome to the Console!!!


***Count() :  it returns the number of times the given has occurred.
str2 = AbracaDabra
countstr = str2.count("a")
print(countstr)
output = 4
